# Predicting human perceptual decisions from neural activity

Master thesis project from the Data Science Master at the Universitat de Barcelona

Using Github mainly for working between my Linux computer (GPU usage for some experiments) and IOS. Also for version control and easy access to the code for supervising purposes.

For most of the notebooks, the folder 'Cond_CJ_EEG' ought to be in the root. This folder contains all the EEG data separated by associated experiment and stored in .fif extension (epoch data).
